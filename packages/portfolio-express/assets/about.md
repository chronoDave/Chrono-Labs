##### About

<box>

Hey there, I'm Dave.

I'm a 23 year old Dutch maker and I do front-end programming for a living. In my free time, I enjoy writing software, pushing pixels, tinkering with hardware, making music and playing games.

##### Values

<box>

As a maker, I keep a couple things in mind when I create something:

 - <b>Respect privacy and embrace transparency</b>. A user has the right to know what data is being collected and why.
 - <b>Embrace personality</b>. Every user is different and should be able to configure things so it works best for them. This extends to accessibility as well.
 - <b>Form follows function</b>. Everything must be designed for a reason.
 - <b>Less is more</b>. More often than not, the simplest solution is the best solution. Don't overcomplicate things if you don't have to.
 - <b>Physical over digital</b>. If possible, hardware should be physical instead of digital. Tactility matters.

Summarized, I would consider myself a minimalist. I firmly believe that a lot of things we use and interact with daily should be more customizable and transparent, but also simplified and optimized. Therefore, I strive to uphold these values within my own works.

##### Personal

<box>

Outside of working on projects, I thoroughly enjoy listening to music (part of why I created [Doombox](https://github.com/chronoDave/Doombox)) and gaming. I'm a proud owner of both a vinyl and CD player and I enjoy collecting obscure music.

For games, I'm a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and JRPG's, such as Europa Universalis 4 and Final Fantasy X. Nowadays I mostly play FFXIV and you can find me on Omega Chaos by the name Jun Nanase.
