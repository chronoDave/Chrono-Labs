##### About

<box>

Hey there, I'm Dave!

I'm a 23 year old Dutch multimedia designer and I'm currently working as a front-end developer. In my free time I write software, push pixels, tinker with hardware, make music and play games.

##### Values

<box>

As a multimedia designer, I keep a couple things in mind when I create something:

 - <b>Respect privacy and embrace transparency</b>. Every user has the right to know how their data is being collected and used.
 - <b>Iterate</b>. Nothing is perfect after the first attempt. Iterate often to make sure you're making the _right_ thing.
 - <b>Embrace individuality</b>. Every users has their own desires. It's the role of the designer to make sure those desires are fullfilled, meaning customization and accesibility should be readibly available.
 - <b>Form follows function</b>. Everything must be designed for a reason.
 - <b>Less is more</b>. More often than not, the simplest solution is the best solution. Don't overcomplicate things if you don't have to.
 - <b>Physical over digital</b>. If possible, hardware should be physical instead of digital. Tactility matters.

Summarized, I would consider myself a minimalist. I firmly believe that a lot of things we use and interact with daily should be more customizable, accessible and transparent, but also simplified and optimized. Therefore, I strive to uphold these values within my own works.

##### Personal

<box>

Outside of work, I thoroughly enjoy listening to music (part of why I created [Doombox](https://github.com/chronoDave/Doombox)) and playing games. I'm a proud owner of both vinyl and CD's and I enjoy collecting obscure music.

When it comes to games, I'm a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and JRPG's, such as Europa Universalis 4 and Final Fantasy X.
