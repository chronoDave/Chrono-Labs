#### Introduction

Companion AI & You is an experimental project I've done during Tech Lab, a 3rd year self-exploration assignment that lasted for half a year. The goal is to ask you, the reader, various questions regarding AI with the main question being:

> Is it possible to have a relationship with an AI?

#### Context

The Tech Lab assignment is as follows:

> Tech lab develops new applications of technology by producing prototypes that are based on future or present based scenarios which demonstrate a desired effect on systems and people within a multidisciplinary context.

> We ask the following questions to guide you through your project:

> <b>Context</b> Within which domains do you situate your design?

> <b>Urgency</b> Why is it important now?

> <b>Vision</b> How do you relate as a designer to the current situation?

> <b>Effect</b> In what way should your design influence people or society?

> <b>Innovation</b> What makes your design a novelty?

I chose <b>machine learning</b> as my context as it fascinates me. Especially now, looking back, it's crazy how quickly things are advancing. For example,  anybody with a good enough pc can now create [real-time](https://github.com/alew3/faceit_live) [deepfakes](https://github.com/9of9/avatarify-windows) which wasn't possible when I started this project.

I believed then (and still do now) that machine learning will be a very important technology that will raise a lot of philosophical questions. This isn't new, of course; people have been thinking about AI for [quite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot) [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer).

As machine learning is quite a broad topic, I decided to specialize myself in <b>chatbots</b>.

I find the idea of advanced chatbots very interesting and I asked myself the following questions:

 - <b>Is it possible to have a relationship with a chatbot and if so, what kind of relationship would it be?</b>

 - <b>How do we respond to people who emphasize with chatbots?</b>

 - <b>Who's responsible for the things a chatbot says?</b>

To make these questions more provocative, I created a game which purpose is to raise these questions.

The game, called <b>Virtual Dating Action Shangri LA</b>, is a speed-dating game where you date various human characters and a single chatbot. The goal of the game is to find a match within 3 in-game days. The game is [free to download for Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_NlrkheXVCK5hfO8QF27nR4Zr9ZnADp/view?usp=sharing).

The game was made with [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) and written in their proprierty language, [GML](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/source/_build/3_scripting/3_gml_overview/index.html).
