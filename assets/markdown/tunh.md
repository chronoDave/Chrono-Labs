東方運命の星 (Touhou Unmei no Hoshi) is a [Touhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) fangame made with the [PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), where you shoot bullets at the enemy whilst avoiding getting shot yourself.

As PICO-8 is a rather limited console, the game contains the following features:

 - **2 playable characters**: Reimu Hakurai and Marisa Kirisame.
 - **4 enemies** with a total of **16 spellcards**.
 - **5 unique music tracks**, which can be listened to in the Music Room.
 - A rudimentary score system.
 - A practice system, where each boss can be practiced against.

And the following mechanics:

 - **Slow**, your character slows down whilst shooting. How much you slow down depends on your selected character (33% speed for Reimu, 50% for Marisa).
 - **Bomb**, you start with 3 bombs which can be used to clear the screen. For each enemy you defeat, you get one bomb.
 - **Lives**, when you get hit, you'll lose a life. When you lose all lives, you game over. Lives cannot be replenished, so don't forget to use your bombs! The amount of lives depends on the difficulty chosen.
