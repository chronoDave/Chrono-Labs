#### Hey there!

I'm a 23 year old Dutch multimedia designer and I'm currently working as a front-end developer. In my free time I enjoy writing software, creating games and pushing pixels.

<h4 align="center">Values</h4>

As a multimedia designer, I keep a couple things in mind when I create something:

 - <b>Respect privacy</b>. Every user has the right to know how their data is being collected and used. I strive to collect the least amount of data possible, meaning that my website does not use any form of tracking.
 - <b>Embrace transparency</b>. I'm a big supporter of [open source software](https://github.com/chronoDave).
 - <b>Iterate</b>. Nothing is perfect after the first attempt. Iterate often to make sure you're making the _right_ thing.
 - <b>Embrace individuality</b>. Every users has their own desires and it's the role of the designer to make sure those desires are fulfilled, meaning customization and accessibility should be readily available.
 - <b>Form follows function</b>. Everything must be designed for a reason. Remove things that don't have functional value.
 - <b>Less is more</b>. More often than not, the simplest solution is the best solution. Don't overcomplicate things if you don't have to.
 - <b>Physical over digital</b>. If possible, hardware should be physical instead of digital. Tactility matters.

Summarized, I would consider myself a minimalist. I firmly believe that a lot of things we use and interact with daily should be more customizable, accessible and transparent, but also simplified and optimized. Therefore, I strive to uphold these values within my own works.

Outside of work, I thoroughly enjoy listening to music (part of why I created [Doombox](https://github.com/chronoDave/Doombox)) and playing games. I'm a proud owner of both vinyl and CD's and I enjoy collecting obscure music.

When it comes to games, I'm a huge fan of (turn-based) strategy games and JRPG's, such as Europa Universalis 4 and Final Fantasy X.

Oh, and check out [Subset Games](https://subsetgames.com/) and [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/). They make amazing games.
