Doombox is a music player designed and built to support a large, personal music collection. It's free, [open source](https://github.com/chronoDave/Doombox) and high customizable. It's built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and supports both Windows and Mac operating systems.

It currently features:

 - **A full responsive design on both axis**. Originally designed for **640 x 480**, it now supports resolutions as low as **320 x 240**.
 - **Speed**. Doombox uses a custom virtualization implementation to keep things _fast_.
 - **Grouping**. Doombox natively supports grouping by label, making navigation through large(r) music libraries easy.
 - **Localization**. Doombox implements its own localization tags, which can be used to switch between native and localized tags.
 - **Native**. Doombox is built with Electron and extends its native capabilities. This is includes things such as MediaMetadata, menus and more. 

You can download it for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/chronoDave/Doombox/releases).

I've been working on Doombox for nearly 2 years as of writing, and a lot has changed over the years. I personally find it very interesting to see how both my skills and needs have changed and how this reflects in the overal design.
